# Notes

1. can have multiple base conditions
2. draw recursion tree for better understanding
3. mostly for all recursion, pass two variable, one to loop on and other which is limit
4. not compulsory to use two variables, recursion can be solved with single limit variable as well
5. backtracking basically means, print data before ending function, not before making recursion call
6. parameterized recursion is basically pass extra params to get ans
7. in functional recursion we break down problem in sub problem
