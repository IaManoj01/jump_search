# Notes

- When a function calls itself until a specified condition is met (base case)

1. Can have multiple base conditions
2. Draw recursion tree for better understanding
3. Mostly for all recursion, pass two variable, one to pass on updated value and other which is limit
4. It is not compulsory to use two variables, recursion can be solved with single variable as well to pass on updated value

**Backtracking** : Print data before end of the function, not before making recursive call

**Parameterized recursion** : It is basically passing extra params to get answer

**Functional recursion** : In functional recursion we break down problem in sub problem
