# Selection Sort

- Select minimum and swap
- Time complexity is `O(n^2)`

```java
int[] arr = {13, 46, 24, 52, 20, 9};
```

- From above image its clear that outer loop `i` will run from 0 to n-2 i.e `[0,n-2]`
- For inner loop we will start from `i` till `n-1` every time to find minimum i.e `[i,n-1]`
